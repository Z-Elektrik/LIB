# Z Elektrik KiCad parts
Welcome to Z Elektrik KiCad EDA Public library.

## Description
These libraries contains components, which are mostly used in the Z Elektrik, with additional fields as:
- MFG (Manufacturer name)
- MPN (Manufacturer Part Number). Libraries are atomic type (besides Generic library), due this even simple resistor have own MPN
- Device marking. Very Helpfull for small SMD devices as SOT-23.
- Technology. Field with filled values: SMD/THD/Mechanical/Graphical, which can create BOM more precise. Ex: Assembly THD only.
- Order code for LCSC, Mouser, RS, Distrelec, TME, Farnell, DigiKey, and SOS
- Unique Z Elektrik's internal stock ID. Use of this library for place assembly order to our company, make setup process in easy way.


## Usage
You can use git client to clone repository, or [download](https://codeload.github.com/Z-Elektrik/LIB/zip/refs/heads/main) zip file and unpack content to your KiCad library folder.

SCH folder contains component and schematic symbols

PCB folder contains footprints

3D folder contains 3D models



## Details
### Symbols libraries
Library name convention like: **FUNCTION_PARAMETERS_MANUFACTURER**
- FUNCTION: Audio, Capacitor, EMI, Fuse, Header, IC, Inductor, Jumper, Mechanical, Opto, Power, Relay, Resistor, Sensor, Switch, Terminal,...
- PARAMETERS:
   - for capacitors can be technology (SMD/THD), Package size or LeadSpan, Voltage rating, tolerance and used material
   - for resistors can be technology (SMD/THD), Package size or LeadSpan, Power rating, tolerance, stability
- MANUFACTURER:
   - Name of manufacturer ex: Samsung, Panasonic etc. If part is not atomic (haven't MPN), as manufacturer can be entered "Generic"

**Used Reference Designators**

Used letters doesn't meet function's class code according to IEC 60617, nor type codes according to IEEE 315.
We use own RefDes system. Here is it:

| RefDes | component types|

| BT | Battery |
| C | Capacitor |
| CN | Any Connector - Plug or Jack, used for **internal** connecting, header, programming header, ZIF connector, Faston contact etc.|
| D | Diode - General, Schottky, Zener |
| F | Fuse |
| FH | Fuse holder |
| FLT | Filters EMC/EMI |
| IC | Integrated Circuit |
| JP | Jumper, jumer on PCB |
| K | Relay |
| L | Inductor |
| LD | LED Diode |
| LS | Acoustic indicator, Loud speaker, buzzer |
| MCU | Microcontroller |
| MP | Mechanical Parts, Knobs, Nuts, DIN Rail Support |
| PSU | Power module, DCDC Converter module, ACDC Converter module - not IC |
| Q | Transistor |
| R | Resistor, Shunt |
| RN | Resistor - net |
| RV | Resistor - variable, potentiometer, trimmer |
| RT | Resistor - termistor |
| SW | Switch, push button, DIP switch |
| TP | Test Point |
| TVS | Transient voltage supressor, Transient suppresion diode |
| VR | Varistor |
| XC | Any Connector - Plug or Jack, used for **external** connecting, Terminal headers, USB, etc.|
